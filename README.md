flutter_open_chinese_convert bridges OpenCC (開放中文轉換) to your Flutter
projects. You can use the package to convert Traditional Chinese to Simplified
Chinese, and vise versa.

The package supports various conversion options:

- S2T: Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese.
- T2S: Traditional Chinese to Simplified Chinese.
- S2HK: Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong Standard).
- HK2S: Traditional Chinese (Hong Kong Standard) to Simplified Chinese.
- S2TW: Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan Standard).
- TW2S: Traditional Chinese (Taiwan Standard) to Simplified Chinese.
- S2TWp: Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese (Taiwan Standard) with Taiwanese idiom.
- TW2Sp: Traditional Chinese (Taiwan Standard) to Simplified Chinese with Mainland Chinese idiom.

## Usage

All you need to do is to call `ChineseConverter.convert` with what you wan to
convert and a conversion option. For example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_open_chinese_convert/flutter_open_chinese_convert.dart';

var text = '鼠标里面的硅二极管坏了，导致光标分辨率降低。';
var result = await ChineseConverter.convert(text, S2TWp());
// 滑鼠裡面的矽二極體壞了，導致游標解析度降低。
```
